hbcucoin
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[hbcucoin](https://www.hbcucoinproject.org/hbcucoin-wallets/) is the original hbcucoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of hbcucoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from one to two hours. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run hbcucoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run in terminal:

- ./hbcucoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or ./hbcucoind (headless, 32-bit)
- ./hbcucoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or ./hbcucoind (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Run the installer, and then run hbcucoin-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag hbcucoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run hbcucoin-Qt.
