building the HBCUR wallet on the RPi can take forever and fail multiple times before succeeding (if ever).
I recommend using the depends toolkit and building the ARM/RASPi wallet on Debian 9 (VM or install).
Then, you just need a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed, and you can copy the wallet with no dependencies.
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Here are some tips:

Install Debian 9 in a virtual machine or download on from OSboxes.org - http://www.osboxes.org/debian/

Install the build environment dependencies for the Raspberry Pi -
Code:
sudo apt install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config curl gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

build the dependencies for the HBCUR wallet without the GUI (cli only) building for QT needs work -
Code:
cd depends && make HOST=aarch64-linux-gnu NO_QT=1

Change back to the HBCUR root directory
Code:
cd ..

Prepare the configure script -
Code:
sh autogen.sh

Configure for the build No GUI, cli only-
Code:
./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/depends/aarch64-linux-gnu

Build it -
Code:
make

Strip the debug symbols -
Code:
aarch64-linux-gnu-strip src/hbcurd src/hbcur-cli src/hbcur-tx

Grab those three files (src/hbcurd src/hbcur-cli src/hbcur-tx),
and copy them to your raspberry pi via the SD card or scp/sftp.

Startup scripts for the Raspberry Pi are more complicated using either System V or Systemd.
This is loosely documented in various Pi forums, PM me if you need further assistance with this.

All of this is documented here -
